README!

Most of these files were taken and modified from:
http://pbrisbin.com:8080/pages/content.php

If you have any questions you may want to look there for some clarification.
This is mostly a git for my personal backup needs, so the instructions here
only cover the basics to get you started, you'll have to look through these and
likely tweak them for your needs before they work like they should for you.

Included in this git directory are my dotfiles, the most interesting ones being
'.xmonad/xmonad.hs' '.mutt/' '.msmtprc', and '.offlineimaprc'

* For XMonad:

Make sure you've got xmonad, xmonad-contrib, and xmobar installed.  xmonad.hs
references a few programs you probably don't have installed, so replace them as
necessary (though I highly recommend dmenu).  Drop this baby into place and
recompile; you should be good to go.  Of note is the scratchPad layer: press
Mod4+v to toggle it (work in progress -- I hope to put a transparent instance
of conky on this soon with some other stuff)

* For Mutt:

This is a multiuser setup for mutt that copies all files from an IMAP server to
the folder ~/Mail/ which mutt then queries.  A cron job checks for new mail
every minute by using the .bin/mailcheck.sh script (see below for setup). Make
sure you've got msmtp, offlineimap, cron, and mutt-sidebar installed (Arch
users: mutt-sidebar is in AUR). To quickly configure this, I've replaced all
the values I use with the following: (you can replace them with regexps which I
give below)

# Values for your primary email account:
<primary_first_name>
<primary_last_name>
<primary_username>
<primary_server>
<primary_password> ### You want to 'grep -r "_password>" *' and replace it by hand.
<primary_imap_port>
<primary_smtp_port>
# Values for your secondary email account:
<secondary_first_name>
<secondary_last_name>
<secondary_username>
<secondary_server> ### See comment for <primary_password>
<secondary_password>
<secondary_imap_port>
<secondary_smtp_port>

(note to self: replace these to use camal case in the next update so the
special characters don't need to be escaped when being replaced)

1. Before replacing these, you'll want to 'grep -r "_password>" ~/*' to find
where all these are located and then replace them by hand; the regexp string
I'm about to show requires you to escape all non-alphanumeric characters with a
'\' and it can get a little crazy when you have passwords like mine.

2. Use this string in the command prompt to recursively search through all
files in your current directory and replace text matching a certain string with
the values you specify in place of ###:
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 perl -i.bak -pe 's/#####/\<primary\_imap\_port\>/g'
In this case goes through all files in your current directory and all
directories below it, replacing <primary_imap_port> with ###, where ### is
whatever you want it to be.  Make sure when using this that you preceed all
non-alphanumeric characters you want to find and replace with a '\'.  Note:
This does NOT replace filenames, ONLY the stuff inside the files. Now that
you've got all the proper values (hopefully), make sure to go and check to make
sure you didn't forget to escape a character.

3. Go into ~/.mutt and replace the *.muttrc and *.signature file names with
the appropriate username.

4. chmod your ~/.msmtprc and ~/.offlineimaprc to 600 to prevent people from
seeing your password:
chmod 600 ~/.msmtprc
chmod 600 ~/.offlineimaprc

5. Download the stuff on your IMAP server (only do this once, cron takes care
of new emails after this):
offlineimap -o -q

6. Make sure you have ~/.bin/mailrun.sh and that it's set to to executable
(chmod 700) and then add it to a cron job like so:
cronttab -e
and enter this before saving the file:
*/3 * * * * ~/.bin/mailrun.sh
restart crond:
sudo /etc/rc.d/crond restart

7. Run mutt! It should be working now.  To hilight mailboxes, use ctrl-j 
and ctrl-k for up and down, and ctrl-l to select it (this may have changed,
when in doubt, check ~/.mutt/muttrc).


If you've made it this far, then you're free to msg me on irc.freenode.org
with any questions, though you might do better to check out the site I got
most of this from first:
